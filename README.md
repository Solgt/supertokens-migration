# supertokens-migration üîèüë•

Scripts to migrate users from one Supertokens deployment to another. Migrates user info, providers, roles and metadata from a source (assumed development) to target (assumed production).

## Prerequisites

-   Requires `bun` to run.
-   Tested with Supertokens Core `v7.0`.
-   Roles and permissions must match between the two environments.
-   All userIds are fetched through a role common to all (default is `user`). If you wish to get all userIds through different role, add third argument to `getAllUserIds()` function or modify it entirely if you want to use different means.
-   Api keys and connection URI required to the two environments. The development (source) credentials are assumed to be in `.env` and the production (target) in `.env.production`. Double-check that these are `.gitignored`. If you want to modify the source and target, look in the `loadEnvironmentAndVerifyEnvVars()`. The keys looked for are:
    -   `AUTH_SUPERTOKENS_API_KEY`
    -   `AUTH_SUPERTOKENS_CONNECTION_URI`

## Install and Run

-   Install with `bun i`
-   Run with `bun run migrate`

## Notes

-   Metadata migration expects there to be a non-empty object. If you have users that have no metadata (empty object), this will be flagged as a failed migration for the user in question but the script will continue.
-   Script can be run multiple times over to refresh recent changes.
